<p>Introduction <br>
I chose robotics for my project. My goal was to use Lego technic and Mindstorms to create a robotic arm. In the past I had used Lego technic to create robots and had some experience programming. The robots I had made in the past were mostly cars; I had not previously made an articulated arm. <br><br>
Objective <br><br>
I had to build a robot based on the industrial robot arms found in factories. The criteria for my robotic arm was that it could rotate, move up and down and pick up items. I wanted the robot to have sensors so I could program it to automatically pick up items. <br><br>
Results <br><br>
The robotic arm I created fit all the criteria. It used 3 motors to move up and down, rotate and grab a small cube. The robot had a light sensor on the arm and an ultrasonic sensor in the base. Due to having a limited time for programming, I was not able to automate my robot. I instead programmed the buttons on the ev3 brick to move the arm up and down and to activate the grabber. 2 button pieces are placed on the base to rotate the robot. I also made a turret that shoots beams using flywheels and a small model car with a working driveshaft.  <br><br>
Planning and construction <br><br>
I had thought about the construction of my robot in my head before I started. I knew I could use a turn table for the base and use lift arms to raise the grabber. I wanted the robot to have sensors so it could be automated. I began construction by creating the robotic arm. Partway through making the arm, I decided I wanted to put the arm on wheels so it would be like a bomb diffusing robot. After making a wheeled base I changed my mind due to not having enough motors for both the arm and the base. I finished the arm, created the grabbing tool and then made a base for the robot. A large motor is used to lift the arm up and down and 2 medium motors are used for the grabber and the rotation. At this point the construction of the robot was done and I began working on small side projects. I made a 4x4 model car with a functioning driveshaft and differentials. I also made a gun that could shoot out beams. The gun used flywheels and a conveyor belt. I released that making side projects was not the best use of time and coded the robot. I did not have a large amount of time left so I decided to make the robot controlled by buttons rather than automated which was simpler to do.  <br><br>
Discussion <br><br>
I ran into multiple challenges while doing this project. Briefly deciding to put the robot on wheels wasted some time. Next time I should have a clear plan about what should be done. Another factor that reduced the time I had was working on side projects. My side projects still taught me about engineering, however I should have worked on them after I had coded my robot. The reductions in time meant I had little time to code, so I had to make the code simple. The robot is controlled with buttons rather than being automated. An issue was that the EV3 brick did not have enough buttons to control the robot. I solved this by adding 2 buttons to the base. I had originally planned to have the robot automated but lack of time meant I could not. It is a good lesson that I should work on my main project in clarity and focus so I do not have similar issues in the future. I had 2 engineering issues with my robot. The medium motor that rotates the arm must be pressed down slightly so that a cog does not slip. This issue is quite hard to solve because the robotic arm is heavy. A way I could have solved this issue would be to have the motor pointing in the same direction as the turn table rather than powering it at a right angle. The other issue I encountered was the heavy arm tilting the structure. I solved this by placing the ev3 brick at the base and using a tyre as a counterweight on the other side of the arm. <br><br>
